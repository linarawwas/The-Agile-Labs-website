HERO SECTION
  - The Agile Labs
  - This is the place for creating dangerously, experimenting with new projects that align with my interests, thus called "Labs", and they're "Agile" because I like to execute with flexibility and implement agile development methods.
  

OUR PERSPECTIVE
  - Our Perspective
  - Most software fails through complexity, neglect, and rushed decisions made permanent.
  - Our work prioritizes clarity over speed, structure over novelty, and decisions that still make sense years later.

WHAT WE DO
  - What We Do
  - Product architecture & system design
  - Full-stack web engineering
  - Technical leadership & codebase recovery
  - Long-term platform development
  - We work with a limited number of clients at a time. Depth matters more than volume.

HOW WE WORK
  - How We Work
  - Small team. Direct communication. Clear ownership.
  - We don't outsource judgment, and we don't disappear after delivery.
  - Our clients value calm execution, honest timelines, and software that doesn't require constant rescue.

WHO WE WORK WITH
  - Who We Work With
  - Founders and teams who have outgrown improvisation.
  - Organizations that understand software is an asset, not a liability.
  - If you are optimizing for durability, we are aligned.
